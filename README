Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Prerequisites:

- Install the OMNET++ simulation framework from: http://www.omnetpp.org/

  Detailed installation instructions can be found on their homepage.

- Install the INET networks simulation package (add-on for OMNET++) from: http://inet.omnetpp.org/

  Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file in the INET tarball.

Clock Sync Simulation:

- Create a copy of the repository of this project in the same directory where the INET
  sources reside. That's because the Makefile needs access to the INET header files.
  The INET directory should be called just 'inet'.

  An example for a working constellation:

    ~/work/inet         <- sources of INET
    ~/work/ptpsim       <- sources of this project

  Alternatively, you can:

  - Create a symlink called 'inet' that points to the read INET directory.

  - Change the variable INETDIR in the top level Makefile of this project.

- Use these commands to compile and run the ptp simulation:

    > make makefiles
    > make
    > make run-sim
